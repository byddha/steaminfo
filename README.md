##### Description
Lists both native and proton steam installed games. Handles multiple steam libraries. 

Provides file hyperlinks for the install and compatdata paths for both compact and full mode (requires terminal with `OSC 8` support, [pretty much all of them](https://github.com/Alhadis/OSC8-Adoption)). 

Also displays game icons on terminals that support `kitty graphics protocol` (kitty, ghostty, wezterm, and [a few more](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/)).

##### Dependencies
Requires `convert` (ImageMagick) to cache image thumbnails. Game icons will be disabled otherwise.

##### Disclaimer
Flatpak and snap steam locations theoretically supported, but untested.
